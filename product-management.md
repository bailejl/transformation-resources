# Product Management Resources

My view of Product Management is heavily defined by Marty Cagan, Google Ventures, Steve Blank and others from
modern tech companies.  I have never been a product manager by role, but have used the teachings from the people and 
organizations mentioned earlier when leading teams.  On several occasions, I would need to deal with stakeholders and 
users.  What I learned from the product management discipline was helpful.  

# Books

- [Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35249663-inspired)
  - Having read the first and second editions, the first edition got me interested in how to connect with my users needs.
  The second edition, is much more relevant to technology product of today and how they are built in an Agile fashion.
  I highly recommend this book.  Note, this is book is shallow in details.  If you are looking for something with a lot of 
  details, this is not it.  However, you will get a solid cover of all the aspects of product management.
- [Business Model Generation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7723797-business-model-generation)
  - This book introduces and explains the the Business Model Canvas (BMC).  The BMC is a single page view of a business
  model broken into 9 key sections.  This is a great tool for exploring the viability of new products.  I have 
  personally used the BMC to vet several business ideas.  It is better to know your idea is a failure in weeks to months,
  instead of learning years later when it fails.
- [Value Proposition Design: How to Create Products and Services Customers Want](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22337524-value-proposition-design)
  - A book by the authors of Business Model Generation.  It is a helpful guide for flushing out value propositions,
  which is a key section in the Business Model Canvas.
- [Running Lean: Iterate from Plan A to a Plan That Works](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13078769-running-lean)
  - A good book from the lean startup perspective.  It has its own take on the business model canvas called the 
  Lean Model Canvas.  This canvas is geared towards web based products.
- [Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814544-sprint)
  - Having been a long time read of the Google Venture's Library, I got a good introduction to the content of the book 
  before it was release.  Thus, I have not read the book, but having read the base material of the book, I am big 
  supporter of the process.

## Rapid Prototyping & Product Management by Tom Chi at Mind the Product San Francisco

Tom Chi is new to me, but has great experience in delivering some well known products.  His process is very Agile and
customer focused, which I love.  Having been in organizations where product managers cannot interact with the user or 
customer.  Tom's video is the complete opposite, he engages with users multiple times a week with software updates.
