## Rapid Prototyping & Product Management by Tom Chi at Mind the Product San Francisco

Tom Chi is new to me, but has great experience in delivering some well known products.  His process is very Agile and
customer focused, which I love.  Having been in organizations where product managers cannot interact with the user or 
customer.  Tom's video is the complete opposite, he engages with users multiple times a week with software updates.
