# Books

There are a tons of books on DevOps, this is only a few based I have read or are looking to read.

- [The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26083308-the-devops-handbook)
  - Great book for people wanting to learn how to implement DevOps within an organization.
- [Accelerate: Building and Scaling High-Performing Technology Organizations](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35747076-accelerate)
  - From the team who does the State of DevOps reports.  This gets into the details behind the report.  I love the report, 
  but have only scratched the surface of this book.  Thus, I cannot comment on it.
- [The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project)
  - A DevOps book written in novel form showing the pains of a non-DevOps world impacting the strategically important 
  business software project.  
- [Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases Through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8686650-continuous-delivery)
  - This is my guideline for how I create a CD pipeline.  I highly recommend this book.
- [Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27968891-site-reliability-engineering)
  - A great look into the SRE world, which pre-dates DevOps.  What I really like about this book when I first read it, is two things.
  One, it was a concrete example of one way to do DevOps.  Two, how they aligned every group to work towards the same goal, which broke down silos.
- [The Unicorn Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44333183-the-unicorn-project)
  - I am currently reading this book.  At one point in my reading, I wanted to roll up in corner when Maxine has issues
   getting her tickets resolved, so she can do work.
  This just reminded me of the time, a project required over 300 tickets to get our system and environments built.
- [Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44135420-team-topologies)
  - I have not read yet, but have been a user of the DevOps Topologies website for years.  Look forward to reading the book.
- [Hello Startup](https://www.hello-startup.net/)
  - This is not a "DevOps" book exactly, but it covers much more with a section relevant to DevOps.  Note, the author is the founder of [Gruntwork](https://gruntwork.io/) a company focusing on DevOps
- [Terraform Up & Running](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/)
  - A book by the founder of Hello Startup.  I have not read the book, so I cannot comment on it.

## The Secrets of High Performing Technology Organizations

Jez Humble doing a great review of the 2019 State of DevOps report by DORA at cloud.google.com/devops.  I really like
the State of DevOps work over the years, as it gives good food for thought concerning DevOps and is based on research.
